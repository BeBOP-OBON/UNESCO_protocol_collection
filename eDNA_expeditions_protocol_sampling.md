# BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to conduct eDNA sampling using as a part of UNESCO eDNA expeditions and using the citizen science sampling kits. 

## Summary

UNESCO Environmental DNA Expeditions is a global, citizen science initiative that will help measure marine biodiversity, and the impacts climate change might have on the distribution patterns of marine life, across UNESCO World Heritage marine sites. It is a citizen science initiative, whose objective is to engage local communities in sampling for eDNA and inspire the next generation of ocean professionals. Water sampling is based on citizen science sampling kits, which make sampling easy and with minimal required materials and training. 

Water samples are taken with syringe and filtered through a dual filter capsule of 0.8 μm pore size. It is recommended to filter at least 1.5 liters of water (25x 60 ml syringe). After filtering the filter capsule is emptied of water. Then Longmire's solution is added to the filter to preserve the DNA. A salinity sample and a temperature reading are also taken. The filter, salinity sample, and metadata sheet (i.e. sample sheet) are returned to the UNESCO team for processing. 

## Method description and rationale

This method was chosen as it is easy to execute, it is possible to do in remote areas, without access to equipment or specific materials. Longmire's solution was chosen as a preservation liquid due to it being non-toxic. Sampling is  being conducted by different groups of citizens, and especially youth groups. 


## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

eDNA sampling campaigns are performed across 25 UNESCO World Heritage marine sites. 

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

A minimum amount of 3 people is required to conduct sampling comfortably. One to retrieve the sample and perform the filtering, one to support the sample bag and ensure that the sampling instructions are followed at all steps, and one to record metadata during the sampling on the sample sheet and the app. 

## Safety

Sampling should only be performed in favorable conditions, and care should always be taken when performing sampling for the safety of the people sampling. 

## Training requirements

The people sampling should familiarize themselves by carefully reading through the sampling protocol and viewing the sampling video prior to the sampling campaigns. Other training is not required. 

## Time needed to execute the procedure

For one sample, about 30 minutes are required.
