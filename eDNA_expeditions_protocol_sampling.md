# BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to conduct eDNA sampling as a part of UNESCO eDNA expeditions and using the citizen science sampling kits. 

## Summary

UNESCO Environmental DNA Expeditions is a global, citizen science initiative that will help measure marine biodiversity, and the impacts climate change might have on the distribution patterns of marine life, across UNESCO World Heritage marine sites. It is a citizen science initiative, whose objective is to engage local communities in sampling for eDNA and inspire the next generation of ocean professionals. Water sampling is based on citizen science sampling kits, which make sampling easy and with minimal required materials and training. 

Water samples are taken with syringe and filtered through a dual filter capsule of 0.8 μm pore size. It is recommended to filter at least 1.5 liters of water (25x 60 ml syringe). After filtering the filter capsule is emptied of water. Then Longmire's solution is added to the filter to preserve the DNA. A salinity sample and a temperature reading are also taken. The filter, salinity sample, and metadata sheet (i.e. sample sheet) are returned to the UNESCO team for processing. 

## Method description and rationale

This method was chosen as it is easy to execute, it is possible to do in remote areas, without access to equipment or specific materials. Longmire's solution was chosen as a preservation liquid due to it being non-toxic. Sampling is  being conducted by different groups of citizens, and especially youth groups. 


## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

eDNA sampling campaigns are performed across 25 UNESCO World Heritage marine sites. During the first sampling campaign 21 sampling kits are sent to each site. Five sampling sites are chosen by the local site authority, that represent different habitats, or are known locations of different target species. At each site, four replicate samples are taken, about 5-10 m distance from each other. The site should have a total water depth of less than 15 m, as sampling is done of surface water and it was considered by the scientific advisory board that relevant detections could not be made from areas with a deeper water column with this method. 

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

A minimum amount of 3 people is required to conduct sampling comfortably. One to retrieve the sample and perform the filtering, one to support the sample bag and ensure that the sampling instructions are followed at all steps, and one to record metadata during the sampling on the sample sheet and the app. 

## Safety

Sampling should only be performed in favorable weather conditions, and care should always be taken when performing sampling for the safety of the people sampling. 

## Training requirements

The people sampling should familiarize themselves by carefully reading through the sampling protocol and viewing the sampling video prior to the sampling campaigns. Other training is not required. The sampling protocol should be consulted throuhgout the sampling, and is available in the booklet, on the sampling sheet and in the app. 

## Time needed to execute the procedure

For one sample, at least 30 minutes are required.

## Protocol

## Sampling
The  goal  is to  collect 21 samples from  each participating UNESCO  World  Heritage  marine  site, including one  negative control sample (local bottled water) at the end of each sampling campaign.  
- Each  UNESCO  World  Heritage  marine  site  has  determined 5 sampling locations before the start of the sampling day.
- Take 4  replicate  samples  at  each  location (same  time  and location). It is recommended to take replicate samples within 5-10 meters of  each  other,  but  this  can  vary  depending  on  the  size  of  the habitat being sampled. 
- The  total  water  depth  of  the  sampling  locations  should  be shallower than 15 meters(to ensure that the collected eDNA is representative for the sample location).
- Each  sampling  will  provide  a  snapshot  of  marine  biodiversity. The objective is to take all samples during one day across the UNESCO World Heritage marine site. If this is not possible, there is flexibility to choose two different dates for sampling. 
**Warning**: Avoid  contamination  sources,  eg.  all  human  activity, including the bilge pumps of vessels, fish cleaning stations, or port areas.


### **Preparation**
Please specify the preparatory actions you took before you collected the samples and note what equipment was needed to do so (e.g. disinfection of work surfaces, preparations to the equipment you intend to use later on).



- **Step 1**: Determine 5 sampling locations

Determine 5 sampling locations before the start of the sampling day. The sampling locations should be shallower than 15 meters (to ensure that the collected eDNA is representative of the sample location)

- **Step 2**: Download the sample registration app

Download the sample registration app. The app will automatically collect time and location information in the field and allows metadata to be registered and linked to each sample-ID.  
1. Go to the address https://app.ednaexpeditions.org/ on your mobile phone.   
2. Add the application to the homescreen. Allowing this will show the application as a normal application in the phone. 
3. Allow location services for the application, to register the exact location where samples were taken. All information on the application is strictly used in the context of this project. 
4. Register with your email,and you are ready to go! 
5. To start sample registration, press: Add sample.

Once  downloaded,  the  sample  registration  application  will  also  work without  internet  access.  After  recording  the  sample  information,  press save.  The  information  will  be  automatically  uploaded  once  the  mobile phone has access to the internet again. To ensure that all information is uploaded  after  sampling,  make  sure  to  open  the  sample  registration application  at  least  once  after  your  internet  connection  has  been restored.The  application  includesan  electronic  version  of  this  Field  Sampling Booklet,  and  the  video  with  sampling  instructions  (internet  access required).

- **Step 3**: Bring with you the following materials

Provided materials:
1. Sample beaker and rod
2. Thermometer; Check that it is functioning
3. Small container to support the sample bag
4. Field sampling booklet
5. Safety glasses
6. 21 sampling kits and 21 sample information sheets (inside)
7. 21 pencils and 4 clipboards

Materials that need to be provided yourself:
1. 1.5 liters of bottled (clean) water to filter for the negative control
2. A box or cooler to store the filters awau from direct sunlight after sampling
2. A mobile phone with the sample registration application installed

- **Step 4**: Double check the completeness of the sampling kit

Double check the completeness of the sampling kit and the unique sample ID of your filter. Go through the instructions and make sure you understand what needs to be done to filter the sample. In each sampling kit you will find:

1. The sample information sheet
2. Two pairs of gloves
3. A clean and sterile sample bag
4. A sterile 60 ml syringe
5. The eDNA filter with the valve
6. 2 blue caps to close the filter
7. The preservation liquid in a small syringe
8. Three waterproof labels with the unique sample ID
9. A ziplock bag for the filter
10. A 15 ml tube to collect a sample for salinity

### **Sampling**

- **Step 1**: Initiate sampling

    1. When  you  have  arrived  at  the  sampling  location,  open  the  sample registration  application  and  take  the  sample  information  sheet. Sample information should be recorded twice, once in writing on the sheet, and a second time electronically in the application.  
        -  Write  down  the  name  and  email  address  of  the  person(s) sampling. 
        - Record thesample ID (the code located on three labels inside the kit, e.g. “EE0018”).
        - Record  the sampling  time  and  locationby  tapping  on  the application and write down the same information on the sample information sheet. 
        - Also  record  information  about  the  sampling  site:  what  is  the biome (e.g., seagrass beds, coral reefs, kelp forest, sand, mud, rock,  mussel  beds,  mangrove  forest,  estuary)?  Are  there  any visible blooms of algae, or any other organisms?
        - Remember you can also add photos and sampling selfies on the application. This will be helpful in determining what the sampling conditions were, and  contribute to the project’s global communication. 
<br/><br/>
          

- **Step 2**: Collect environmental metadata

2. To determine the salinity, collect 15 ml of water from the sampling location in the separately provided 15 ml tube, then return the tube to the sample kit. Knowing the salinity will improve the final analysis of  the  samples,  since  low salinity can reveal runoff from land, for example. 

3. Record the surface water temperature at the sampling location with the  use  of  the  provided  thermometer.  Add  this  information  in  the sample  registration  application,  and  write  it  down  on  the  sample information sheet.


### **Filtration**

Wear  gloves  at  all  times  during  sampling. Do  not  touch anything else than the sampling equipment to avoid contamination. Also, keep the sampling equipment as clean as possible, and store it in a clean place. 

- **Step 1**: Collect the water

 4. Rinse  the  sampling  bottle  with the rod  three times  with  water  from the sampling location. 
    - If you are close to the shore, aim to take samples as far away  from  land, and you, as  possible  (using  the  rod),  to  avoid contamination (such as runoff from land, or human presence in the water).<br/><br/>
5. Collect the sample, make sure to immerse the bottle approximately 30 cm below the surface.
6. Prepare the sample bag: Rip open the top, and open the bag using the holders on the sides.
7. Place the sample bag inside an empty plastic box (for support).
8. Fill the sample bag 2 times with water collected with the bottle, in total  about 2  liters  of  water.  One  person  should  hold  the  sample bag, while the other does the filtering.

    Note: If  you  are  in  an  area  with  a  sandy  bottom,  let  the  sample  water stand for a few minutes before filtering, to allow the sand to settle at the bottom of the bag.


- **Step 2**: Filter the water

9. Attach the syringe to the valve on the filter
10. Be careful, proceed slowly, the next step will require some effort and patience. If needed, take turns with the person holding the bag.
11. While the inlet (bottom part) of the filter is submerged in the sample water, filter the water from the bag by pulling out the plunger. The water will flow in the direction of the arrow on the filter.
12. Discard the water outside of the bag by pushing on the plunger. The water will come out of the other end of the valve.
13. Count the number of times the syringe is filled and/or the amount of water that you have filtered. Add this information both on the sample registration application and on the sample information sheet.
14. When the filter is full, the filtering will be slower. To keep filtering, pull out the plunger of the syringe and allow the water to flow in slowly. Depending on the locality, there may or may not be color visible on the filter.
15. Aim  to  repeat  20-30  times (25  times  =  1.5  liters)  by  continuously pumping  the  syringe  and  keeping  the  (bottom  part  of  the)  filter submerged. The final amount of water that can be filtered will depend on  local  conditions.  Stop  if  the  filtering  is  too slow,  or  is  taking too long (for example one hour). The filter is then clogged.

    **Warning**: Avoid  air  bubbles  in  the  filter,  this  will  cause  the  filter  to malfunction. To prevent air from being sucked in, let the plunger of the syringe  loose  before  lifting  the  dual filter  capsule  from the water.  If  air bubbles appear in the filter while filtering, they can easily be removed. For example, if filtering has become difficult after less than 10 times, you may  have  an  air  bubble  that  is  clogging  the  filter.  In  this  case  the  air bubble can be removed easily, see steps 25-30.

### **Sample preservation**
Perform these steps once you have filtered the volume of the syringe 20-30 times (25 times = 1.5 liters = 1500 ml) or for about one hour. This step should be performed by an adult wearing gloves and safety glasses.


- **Step 1**: Empty the filter

16. Empty the remaining water from the filter by sucking in air with the syringe.   

17. Remove the filter from the syringe

- **Step 2**: Add the preservation liquid

18. Wear the safety glasses, be very careful with the preservation liquid, do not swallow, avoid contact with skin and eyes, and do not spill in the environment. All preservation liquid should go into the filter, no preservation liquid should be left. 

    **Note**:If there are white flocs in the preservation liquid, warm it by holding the syringe in your hand, until they dissolve. The white flocs can occur if the  preservation  liquid  has  been  exposed  to temperatures  below  and around +15 °C. 

19. Close the top end of the filter with the cap from the small syringe. The top end is where the valve and filter were. The flow of the preservation liquid will be in the same direction as the sample water during filtering.
20. From the bottom end of the filter (in the direction of the arrow), add the preservation liquid to the filter from the provided small syringe. 

    **Warning**: Be  careful. When  adding  liquid,  pressure  builds  in  the  filter. Relieve the pressure by lifting the plunger before you remove the syringe (replacing the liquid with air from the filter in the small syringe).
21. Close the bottom end of the filter with the second cap provided in the sampling kit.
22. Attach the three labels provided in the sampling kit to   
a. the filter,  
b. the salinity sample, and  
c. the sample information sheet. 

    Make sure that the same sample ID is registered on the sample registration application.
23. Close the filter in its own ziplock bag. This will allow the filter to stay clean also when starting sample processing.
24. Enclose all materials including the filter (in its own bag), the salinity sample, and the sample information sheet in the original sample bag. Save the sample information collected in the application.

### **Storage**

Keep  the  filters  sheltered  from  the  sun  at  all  times,  UV radiation will degrade the collected DNA. All samples should be collected together with the sampling team, kept in the  dark,  and  at  room temperature  conditions,  if possible  (e.g.  20-25  °C). The most important thing is to keep the filters away from direct sunlight. Some heat will not negatively impact the filters and DNA.

## Quality control

A negative control is filtered to identify common contaminants of the sampling process. This is 1,5 l of bottled (drinking) water. 

1. After  all  marine  samples  have  been  filtered,  filter  the  negative control (1.5 liters of bottled water) while still in the field using the exact same protocol
2. Start  by  recording  the  sample  ID,  and  indicate  on  the  sample information  sheet  and  in  the  notes  in  the  sample  registration application thatthis is the negative control. There is no need to collect environmental metadata (location, time, etc.). 
3. Pour  the  bottled  water  in  the  sample  bag,  and  proceed  with filtering and preserving the sample as before.

## Basic troubleshooting guide

### **Removing an air bubble**

Only  perform steps  25  to  30  if  you  suspect you  have  an  air bubble clogging the filter. Air bubbles block the filter membrane and have a negative effect on the filter capacity. These air bubbles are easy to remove from the capsule, by flushing a small amount of sample water through the outlet of the filter (reverse direction).

25. Remove the filter from the syringe, and the valve from the filter from the silicone tubing connected to the valve.
26. Fill the syringe with sample water.
27. Connect the syringe to the outlet of the eDNA dual filter capsule.
28. Turn the filter upwards, so that any air bubble moves up to the inlet.
29. Hold the capsule upwards and push the syringe plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled from the capsule. Warning:Do not allow water to be flushed out of the filter, this will result in the loss of already filtered material.
30. Reconnect  the  capsule  and  syringe  to  the  valve  connector  and proceed with sampling.

### **Note: Sampling from shore**

Avoid contamination especially if it is necessary to sample from shore.
- Only one person should go briefly in the water to collect the sample
- Extend the rod as far as possible to take the sample from a distance to yourself
- Consider the flow of water at the sampling location:
    - Try to take the sample so the water is flowing towards the person that is sampling (not from the person towards the sampling location).
    - e.g. take the sample during incoming tidal flow, or to the side of the person taking the sample
- If available it is always best to wear waders (if possible disinfected with bleach)

### **Note: Preservation liquid**

Care should be taken especially at the step of adding the preservation liquid. Because the preservation liquid is added to a closed filter, a little bit of pressure builds up in the filter. It is very important that the preservation liquid is added from the correct end (the bottom end) of the filter, so that the flow of the liquid is the same as the flow of the sampled water, in the direction of the arrow. After adding the preservation liquid some air should be sucked out with the syringe before the small syringe is removed to avoid any  of the preservation liquid coming out of the filter due to the pressure build-up. 

### **Failure of the two-way valve**

We noticed that some of the two-way valves provided in the sampling kits were leaking air, and were therefore not so effective. In this case the extra cap can be used to close the outlet the valve when filtering water through the filter and inlet of the valve. This will close the system and result in more effective filtering.
